- =Server purpose= /data center/ will have different machinery, depending on the application objetive.
**** Webservers
- Website hosting.
- Database.
- Control panel.
- CMS software.

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 1000px
#+CAPTION: "What is a web server and how does it work?", by Meta
[[file:img/web-server.png][file:./img/web-server.png]]

***** Web request
=Request-response cycle=:
#+begin_quote
It's the job of the web server to send you back those website content, upon requesting, by typing the URL of the website.
#+end_quote

Designed to respond to thousands of requests of clients per second.
*** What are websites and webpages?
**** Webpage
Display content, like text, images, videos etc, on the web browser.
**** Website
It's a collection of web pages linked together.
**** HTML, CSS and JavaScript
***** HTML
=Hyperlink Text Markup Language=
Tells how to structure elements in a page.
***** CSS
Cascade Styling Sheets.
***** JavaScript
Programming language build into the browser.
Tools for =interactivity=, =data-processing= and =control-and-action=.
***** Page rendering process
#+begin_quote
While interpreting each line of HTML, the browser creates a building-block that
switches the visual representation you see on screen.
#+end_quote

A response from the webserver must be a complete web page, in other to fulfill
the request, to show the page, in the browser.
***** Web browsers
Software application used to browse the world-wide-web.

It works by sending a request to a web server, and then receives a response
containing the content to be displayed on your device.
****** URL
=Uniform Resource Locator=, contains the protocol (HTTP/HTTPS), the domain name,
and the file-path.
****** HTTP
- HyperText Transfer Protocol.
- Request-response cycle.
*** TCP - Transmission Control Protocol
- Transmits messages with high precision.
- Barley no data loss.
- Almost always on the right addresses.
- Slower than UDP.
*** UDP - User Datagram Protocol
- Corrupt package issue solved (barely no data loss).
- Easily out of order data-packages.
- Possibly a lot of loss of information.
*** HTTP - HyperText Transfer Protocol
- Standard for the web communication.
- Transfers data:
  - Web pages,
  - Images,
  - Files.
- Request-response based communication between client and server.
*** Makeup of a HTTP request
It must contain a
- Method,
- Path,
- Version,
- Headers.
**** Method
#+begin_quote
Describes the kind of action that the client wants to perform.
#+end_quote

Most common are:
- GET;
- POST;
- PUT;
- DELETE;

***** Get
Retrieves information.
***** Post
Sends information.
***** Put
Update data on webserver. That is, data1 is swapped for data2.
***** Delete
Removes the resource.
**** Path
#+begin_quote
The path is a representation of where the resource is located on the webserver.
#+end_quote
**** Version
#+begin_quote
Rules of what constitutes and how request and response happen.
#+end_quote

**** Headers
#+begin_quote
Headers contains additional information about the request and the client that is making the request.
#+end_quote
*** Makeup of a HTTP response
It's similar to HTTP requests.

After the =header=, the =message body= contains data that is the response:
- Text.
- HTML Markup.
- Images.
- Files.
- etc.
**** Header
- HTTP response status (200, 404, 400, etc.).
- Status message (OK, Not Found, Server Not Responding, etc.).
***** Informational
Responses ranging 100-199.

- Provisional.
- Interim response.
- Most common: 100 CONTINUE.

***** Successful
Responses ranging 200-299.

If successfully processed (200 OK),
- GET: Found/included.
- POST: Successfully transmitted.
- PUT: Successfully transmitted.
- DELETE: Deleted.
***** Redirection
Responses ranging 300-399.

- 301 MOVED PERMANENTLY.
- 302 FOUND.

***** Client error
Responses ranging 400-499.
- 400 BAD DATA (transmitted to the server);
- 401 MUST LOGIN (before making the request);
- 403 REFUSE TO PROCESS (but valid request);
- 404 NOT FOUND (requested data);

***** Server error
Responses ranging 500-599.
- 500 INTERNAL SERVER ERROR (server failed to process request);
*** Examples about HTTP
**** *Request Line*
#+begin_quote
Every HTTP request begins with the request line.

This consists of the HTTP method, the requested resource and the HTTP protocol
version.

=GET /home.html HTTP/1.1=

In this example, =GET= is the HTTP method, =/home.html= is the resource
requested and HTTP 1.1 is the protocol used.
#+end_quote
**** HTTP Method
*** IDEs
=Integrated Development Environment= offers:
- Syntax highlight;
- Keyword documentation;
- Auto-complete suggestions;
- Navigation ease;
- Unified Environment for development;

** Week 3
*** Working with libraries
Libraries can depend on other libraries forming a tree of dependencies.

- Bundlers unify all code in one file, or few of them.
- Finally, add the final bundled file into your HTML.

*** Responsive Design
A =responsive grid= happens when we combine:
- Flexible grids;
- Fluid images;
- Media queries.


**** Flexible grids
- Gutter: space between contents;
- Margin: space between content and screen;
- Sizes based on percentages.

**** Fluid images
- Max-width: 100%;
  - Shrink based on container-element size;
- Fit on page;
- Never grow larger than original size.

**** Media queries
Controls:
- Display size;
- Orientation;
- Aspect ratio.
*** Types of Grids
- Fixed grid;
- Fluid grid;
- Hybrid grid;

**** Fixed Grid
- Fixed width-columns;
- Flexible-margins;

**** Fluid grid
- Fluid width-columns;
- Fixed-gutters;
- Fixed-margins;

Columns either grow or shrink to adapt to the available space.

**** Hybrid grid
- Fluid and fixed width components;
- Different rules, depending on device;
- Optimize experience.
*** Bootstrap

**** Responsive design with class infix
Convention for =class infix= made for =responsive design=, by *Bootstrap*.
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 800px
[[file:img/bootstrap.png][file:./img/bootstrap.png]]

**** Class modifiers
It's like the conjugation of verbs, so you have different meaning, with the same functionality. E.i., buttons of alert that can mean "just pay attention", or "*DANGER!*" etc.
*** Static vs Dinamic websites
**** Static part of a website
- Images;
- Videos;
- Text.
**** Dinamic part of a website
Static content that is generated, depending on the response of an =application server=.

To speed up the process and don't overload the website, =cache= is used to store dynamically generated content.

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 700px
[[file:img/cache.png][file:./img/cache.png]]

*** SPA and Multi-Page Application
**** Multi-page Application
- Loads all content at each update
- Application server return the entire webpage
 
**** SPA
SPA can use both =bundling= and =lazy-load= to display dynamic content.
***** Bundling
When a new component or data is requested the hole section is returned and rendered.
***** Lazy-loading
When a new piece of a component or data is requested, only the fraction of data and component concerned for the request is loaded.

** Week1-Notes - Introduction to Python
*** Course content
#+begin_quote
Course content  
During this course, you’ll cover everything you need to begin with Python development. The content of the four modules is listed below.

*Module 1 - Getting started with Python*
In this module, you will get an introduction to the course and you’ll cover a brief summary of the history of programming. You will also learn the basics of how programming works and discover typical uses for Python in real-life. There are also some tips on how to take this course successfully.

Before embarking on any coding you’ll first establish if your current computer system is set up correctly and identify any required operating system dependencies. Then you’ll explore different ways that you can run programs through Python.

Next, you’ll study Python syntax using comments, variables, data types and user input and output. You’ll proceed to expand your Python skills by using math and logical operators so you can control the flow of your code and perform operations such as addition, subtraction, division, and multiplication.

Python has multiple ways to do code loops or looping. You will examine looping constructs to iterate your code over multiple sequences.

*Module 2 - Basic programming with Python*
In module 2, you'll receive an introduction to Python functions, including how to declare a function, and how to pass data to a function or return data from a function. You will also explore data structures, scope, and the concepts of lists and how they can be used in Python. You will also discover tuples, sets, dictionaries and kwargs, gaining an understanding of how their main uses.

Errors and exceptions are two very important aspects of learning Python as a new developer. In module 2, you will start with errors and exceptions, and explore what happens when something goes wrong with your code. Exception handling and Python file handling are covered, as are how to create files in Python and various methods of inserting content into a new file.

*Module 3 - Programming paradigms*
In the third module, you will cover programming paradigms, and look at the features and concepts behind procedural programming, functional programming and object oriented programming.

A key feature of procedural programming is algorithms, you will explore how they can be used to solve problems, how algorithmic complexity is calculated and learn about Big-O notation.

Next you will learn about pure functions and recursion in functional programming, as well as the difference between maps and filters.

Finally, you will explore object-oriented programming and its four main concepts. ​ You will explore the relationship between classes and instances in Python by creating classes, instantiating them, and accessing their variables and methods. You’ll learn about abstract classes and methods and how to implement them. The rules of method resolution and inheritance with child and parent classes are also explained. Being able to read files is essential when working with stored data in Python and you’ll discover several built-in functions to make this easier. 

*Module 4  - Modules, packages, libraries and tools*
In module 4, you learned that Python is a powerful language that allows you to build amazing things. But it can gain even more functionality with the use of modules, libraries and tools. You will learn about Modules and that they are the building blocks for adding functionality to your code, so you don’t need to continually redo everything.

You will also explore some of the commonly used Python libraries in data analysis and data science, and how they can apply to the areas of machine learning and artificial intelligence.

Finally, you’ll find out why testing is an essential component of Quality Assurance and explore the type of testing you should use. You will learn about test automation packages and the importance of automated testing and you’ll write some tests using PyTest. Finally, you will explore the evolution of Test-driven development (or TDD), and focus on how to apply a test-driven development methodology.

*Module 5 - Graded assessment*
Here you'll learn about the graded assessment. After you complete the individual items in this module, you'll test your knowledge and skills by completing an end of course graded assessment.

*** Additional Resources
**** First
Python allows you to do quite a lot with very little code. Compared to other languages such as Java or C#, Python has a much easier learning curve. It lends itself well to the "write less, do more philosophy". Python developers are also in high demand and learning how to program in Python makes for a good career choice.

file = open('test.txt', mode='r')

data = file.readline()

print(data)

file.close()

# alternative
with open('test.txt', mode='r') as file:
    data = file.readline()
    print(data)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:

#+begin_src text :tangle ./Exercises/Python-mod2/test.txt
Hello there!
#+end_src
***** Create file and populate it

#+begin_src python :session localhost :results output :tangle ./Exercises/Python-mod2/files.py

*** Object Oriented Programing (OOP)
Structure:
- Classes;
- Objects;
- Methods.
**** Classes
Logical code-block with =attributes= and =behavior=.

- =Classes= are defined using the key-word =class=;
- =Attributes= can be =variables=;
- =Behavior= can be =functions=.

**** Objects
=Objects= are instances of =Classes=.
#+begin_example
Bundle, to the *class* =employee=, the attributes =position= and =employment_status=
#+end_example

**** OOP in Python
#+begin_quote
You previously encountered the four main pillars of object oriented programming. These are: *encapsulation, polymorphism, inheritance and abstraction*
#+end_quote
**** Istantiation process
- Class definition;
- New Instance;
- Initializing new instance.
**** Attribute References
To access data defined inside the class scope.

**** Examples
#+begin_src python :session localhost :results output
class MyClass():
    a = 5
    print("Hello")

myc = MyClass()
print(MyClass.a)
print(myc.a)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: Hello
: 5
: 5


#+begin_src python :session localhost :results output
class MyClass():
    a = 5
    def hello(self):
        print("Hello, world!")

myc = MyClass()
print(MyClass.a)
print(myc.hello())
myc.hello()
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: 5
: Hello, world!
: None
: Hello, world!

#+begin_src python :session localhost :results output
class House:
    '''
    This is a stub for a class representing a house that can be used to create objects and evaluate different metrics that we may require in constructing it.

The scopes in python are classified as:
- =local=;
- =enclosed=;
- =global=;
- =built-in=;
**** Scope resolution
- LEGB rule
- *Local*: inside funtion;
- Enclosed: inside enclosed or nested function;
- *Global*: upmost level, outside functions;
- Built-in: in the built-in modules;
